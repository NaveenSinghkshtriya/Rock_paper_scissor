# Rock_paper_scissor
 
In these file, we will see how to develop rock, paper and scissor game using python. 
I had generally used List and Random Funciton to design game.

The main idea of the game is User should enter his value which will be from (1-3) , where 1 represent scissor, 2 represent paper, 3 represent Rock. if user enter any other values then it will throw error and ask user to reenter the input. At the end of the game, final score will be displayed and print who had won the match. 
User can play game unitl he give input as 'y', if he want to quit the game he can press 'N'.
